# Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

This is a **small and beginner-friendly interactive dashboard** built using **Power BI**, based on a sample **Superstore sales dataset**.  
It provides a visual overview of sales performance across various categories, regions, time periods, and shipping modes.

Before building the dashboard, I performed essential **data preprocessing**, including:
- Changing data types (Whole Number, Decimal Number, Date)
- Ensuring consistent and clean data structure for accurate visualizations
